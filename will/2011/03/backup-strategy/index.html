  <p>Unfortunately there is no backup silver bullet, so to ensure that I have the computers in my home backuped and secured I use a mix of services. In the following sections I will describe how I use Time Machine, <a href='http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/'>Arq</a> and GitHub to keep my data backed up and secure.</p>

<h3 id='time_machine_and_drobo'>Time Machine and <a href='http://www.drobo.com/products_time_machine.aspx'>Drobo</a></h3>

<p>I use Time Machine to fully backup 3 MacBooks and a MacMini to a <a href='http://www.drobo.com/products_time_machine.aspx'>Drobo</a> that is attached to the MacMini.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The longer Time Machine is used, the more</p>
</blockquote>

<p>data storage it requires. Unlike other protected storage arrays, <a href='http://www.drobo.com/products_time_machine.aspx'>Drobo</a> uses patent-pending BeyondRAID software that is designed for non-technical users who demand both reliability and instant expandability without the complexity of traditional RAID.&#8221; - <a href='http://www.drobo.com/products_time_machine.aspx'><a href='http://www.drobo.com/products_time_machine.aspx'>Drobo</a> Site</a></p>

<p>The <a href='http://www.drobo.com/products_time_machine.aspx'>Drobo</a> provides the ability to &#8220;Hot Swap&#8221; drives if they fail or if space is running out.</p>

<p>If a hard drive fails in any of my computers I can restore from Time Machine in a couple of hours.</p>

<p>The Time Machine solution makes it easy to do full backups and is trivial to setup.</p>

<h3 id='arq'><a href='http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/'>Arq</a></h3>

<p>Thanks to the reliability of <a href='http://www.drobo.com/products_time_machine.aspx'>Drobo</a>, and the daily incremental backups to it via TimeMachine, the only way to have data loss is if the computers and <a href='http://www.drobo.com/products_time_machine.aspx'>Drobo</a> are stolen or somehow destroyed (e.g. by fire). So for a subset of data that I deem most critical, and that would not be recoverable if I lost both my computers and <a href='http://www.drobo.com/products_time_machine.aspx'>Drobo</a>, I use <a href='http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/'>Arq</a>.</p>

<p>I use <a href='http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/'>Arq</a> to back up my most critical files to <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/s3/'>Amazon S3</a>. <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/s3/'>Amazon S3</a> is a &#8220;highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast, and inexpensive infrastructure&#8221; that Amazon uses for its own applications.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/'>Arq</a> backups are complete and accurate, including all &#8220;metadata&#8221;. I do an incremental backup every night on my main computer&#8217;s home direcotry (with a few exceptions - see the final section). My current backup size is 66GB and I transfer about 400MB-700MB per night. This works out at a monthly cost of less than $4.</p>

<p>The speed of transfer to <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/s3/'>S3</a> is amazing. It is almost as fast as the backup to Time Machine (and the size is usually the same). If I could afford to fully backup my computers to <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/s3/'>S3</a> I would and then maybe I could do away with Time Machine.</p>

<p><a href='http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/'>Arq</a> also encrypts the data that is stored on <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/s3/'>S3</a>. I use a generated password to access my <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/s3/'>S3</a> account. The data is encrypted with a generated key. The <a href='http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/'>Arq</a> program remembers this information so I do not need to remember the keys. However since these are complicated passowrd/keys that I do not memorize I need a place to store them securly. And of course I will need access to this if I do not have my computers or <a href='http://www.drobo.com/products_time_machine.aspx'>Drobo</a>. For this I use <a href='http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password'>1Password</a> and <a href='http://dropbox.com'>DropBox</a>.</p>

<h3 id='1password_and_dropbox'><a href='http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password'>1Password</a> and DropBox</h3>

<p><a href='http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password'>1Password</a> is a password management tool that stores all my passwords. I just have to remember one password to unlock the app and I can retrieve any of my passwords. It also has built in browser support so you can easily sign into websites or enter credit card information online.</p>

<p>One of its best features is that you can store the encrypted password file in a shared folder and access it from multiple computers. This way all your computers have all your latest passwords.</p>

<p>Since I often have my laptop offline or not on my home network I alwas want a local copy of this password file. To do this I use <a href='http://dropbox.com'>DropBox</a>.</p>

<p>DropBox allows you to replicate a folder on your computer to their cloud. With this I replicate the folder across all my computers and it manages keeping them in sync. <a href='http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password'>1Password</a> also ensures that if you were accessing the password file from multiple computers at once that the data is not corrupted.</p>

<p>One nice addition to using <a href='http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password'>1Password</a> and DropBox is that there that <a href='http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password'>1Password</a> has an iPhone app that has support for connecting to DropBox also. So now I also have all my passwords on my iPhone too.</p>

<h3 id='excluded_from_backup_to_amazon_s3_simple_storage_service'>Excluded from Backup to <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/s3/'>Amazon S3 (&#8220;Simple Storage Service&#8221;)</a></h3>

<p>I keep all my <a href='http://github.com'>Github</a> repositories in my ~/Development directory and always try to keep my work pushed to <a href='http://github.com'>Github</a>. If I have work in progress changes I usually push them to a branch off of master. Because of this I do not backup my ~/Development directory to <span>Amazon S3</span>](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) since it is redundant. The size of some of my repositories is large too so this is a good thing.</p>

<p>Similarly I have my music replicated over a few computers, ipods, etc. So I do not back this up either to <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/s3/'>Amazon S3</a>.</p>

<p>I also have a <a href='http://flickr.com'>Flickr</a> Pro account that I store all my photos on so I do not backup my Pictures folder to <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/s3/'>Amazon S3</a> either.</p>

<p>There are a number of other folders I exclude that are application related since I can always reinstall the applications (e.g. Library/Caches, Library/Logs, Dropbox, Downloads).</p>
